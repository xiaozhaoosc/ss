# api-skills

> A community-driven collection of Skills for AI agents — providing reusable behaviors, structured references, and ready-to-use integrations to make agent development faster and collaborative.

## What is this?

**api-skills** is a curated collection of modular *Skills* designed for AI agents. Each skill encapsulates a specific behavior or capability — such as interacting with an API, processing files, or automating workflows — so agents can reference and reuse them without reinventing the wheel.

Whether you're building a coding assistant, a data pipeline agent, or a multi-step automation bot, this collection gives you a head start.

## Getting Started

1. **Browse** the `api/` directory to find a skill relevant to your use case.
2. **Read** the skill's `SKILL.md` file — it describes what the skill does, when to trigger it, and how to use it.
3. **Download** the skill in your system as a zip or standalone.
4. **Download** the installer file to install all the skills at once with a single command. More on this in the README.md file inside the `installer/` directory.
5. **Reference** the skill in your agent's system prompt or configuration.

## Skill Format

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

```
api/<category>/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md       # Description, trigger conditions, and usage instructions
```

A `SKILL.md` file typically includes:

- **Name** — The skill's identifier
- **Description** — What it does and when to use it
- **Trigger Conditions** — Keywords or scenarios that should invoke this skill
- **Instructions** — Step-by-step guidance for the agent

## Contributing

Community contributions are what make this repo valuable! You can contribute by:

- **Adding a new skill** for a use case not yet covered
- **Improving an existing skill** with better instructions or examples
- **Sharing example agents** that use skills from this repo

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.

## Why This Exists

Building agents that reliably perform specific tasks requires well-structured, tested, and documented behaviors. Instead of every developer writing their own skill logic from scratch, **api skills** provides a shared foundation — so the community can build on each other's work and iterate faster.
